# Market Research

MEMS Fabry‑Pérot (FPI) systems appeal to drone manufacturers and machine-vision integrators requiring compact, fast spectral scanning. Major vendors include Santec and InfraTec, while large LCTF and AOTF systems from Thorlabs or Gooch & Housego offer competing tunability at greater size or cost.

- Drone remote-sensing is a growing market as precision agriculture and inspection demand lightweight payloads.
- Industrial integrators value the millisecond switching speeds of MEMS FPI compared with slower LCTF designs.
- Pricing for MEMS modules currently ranges from $3k to $8k depending on aperture and range.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Market forecasts predict >$10M annual demand across drone and machine-vision segments.
- At least two vendors provide detailed specs and pricing for comparison.
- Prototype BOM shows competitive cost advantage over AOTF or LCTF alternatives.
