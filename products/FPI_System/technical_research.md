# Technical Research

## Components
- MEMS Fabry-Pérot interferometer module with 5–20 nm bandwidth tuning.
- Mono camera with global shutter and high sensitivity in VIS–NIR.
- Controller board driving the MEMS cavity and synchronizing the camera.

## Performance Goals
- <10 ms switching time between bands for video-rate scanning.
- Maintain >40% optical throughput across 450–900 nm.
- Robust calibration of cavity spacing vs. wavelength using a spectrometer.
