# Market Research

The AOTF system targets high-speed industrial inspection and scientific experiments requiring narrow programmable bands. VIS modules start around $5k while wide-aperture IR versions exceed $30k. Applications include spectral video for process monitoring, semiconductor inspection, and advanced microscopy. Competing solutions include high-end hyperspectral cameras from Photon Etc. or Headwall, often priced above $50k.

- Market demand is concentrated in defense and semiconductor sectors willing to pay for speed.
- Complexity and cost limit wider adoption, but research labs value the microsecond tuning capability.
- Potential growth stems from process control in electronics manufacturing and remote sensing where rapid wavelength selection is essential.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Pricing and spec sheets from at least three AOTF vendors are collected.
- Two target markets demonstrate willingness to pay >$20k per system.
- Prototype cost model confirms ROI within three years for a limited run of 50 units.
