# Technical Research

- Compare TeOâ‚‚ crystals vs. other materials for desired range.
- Characterize RF driver requirements and heat dissipation.
- Develop alignment jigs to manage polarization sensitivity.
- Select broadband source (supercontinuum vs. LED engine) and quantify output power needed.
- Evaluate aperture size vs. spectral resolution trade-offs in available AOTF modules.
- Implement temperature stabilization for the AOTF crystal to maintain tuning accuracy.
- Develop control firmware for rapid wavelength sweeps and multi-line operation.
- Model RF shielding requirements to avoid EMI with nearby electronics.
- Test supercontinuum source coupling efficiency into the AOTF.
