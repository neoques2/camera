# Market Research

## Customers
- UAV and drone imaging where single-frame capture is critical.
- Portable spectroscopy devices demanding compact sensors with no moving parts.

## Competitors
- IMEC and Silios produce mosaic sensors with 4â€“16 bands.
- Traditional push-broom cameras compete when mechanical scanning is acceptable.

Snapshot sensors cost more per pixel but enable instantaneous capture, making them ideal for aerial mapping and some medical imaging applications. Adoption is growing with miniaturized UAV payloads and handheld devices.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Pricing and availability information for at least two mosaic sensor vendors is gathered.
- Case studies show clear advantage over push-broom systems for target applications.
- Unit economics indicate a realistic selling price within 30% of competing snapshot cameras.
