# Technical Research

## Components
- Snapshot mosaic sensor with known filter pattern (e.g., IMX250MZR).
- Color correction matrix derived from factory spectral response.
- Optics optimized for pixel-level filters.

## Performance Goals
- Develop demosaicing algorithm to recover spectral cube.
- Quantify spatial resolution loss vs. number of bands.
- Calibrate per-band spectral response and noise characteristics.
