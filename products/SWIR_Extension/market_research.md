# Market Research

Extending the system into the short-wave infrared (SWIR) opens markets such as plastics sorting, gas-leak detection, and SWIR machine vision. Sony's IMX990 sensor offers a lower-cost (~$3k) option versus traditional InGaAs cameras costing $9kâ€“$20k. Competitors include Sensors Unlimited, Hamamatsu, and Xenics.

- SWIR imaging is growing in recycling, photovoltaic inspection, and defense surveillance.
- Demand for lightweight drone payloads favors uncooled SWIR sensors paired with LEDs or laser diodes.
- Market analysts project double-digit CAGR for SWIR cameras as prices decline.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Market size across key applications exceeds $15M annually with projected growth >10% CAGR.
- At least three competing camera options with pricing and specs are documented.
- Prototype cost analysis shows SWIR extension adds <50% to base system cost while enabling new revenue streams.
