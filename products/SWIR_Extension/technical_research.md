# Technical Research

- Evaluate sensitivity of IMX990 vs. InGaAs sensors.
- Survey SWIR LED sources and suitable bandpass filters.
- Investigate cooling requirements for low-noise SWIR imaging.
- Choose lenses with SWIR coatings and suitable focal lengths.
- Compare off-the-shelf bandpass filters vs. tunable options for illumination.
- Quantify dark current variation with sensor temperature and evaluate cooling methods (TEC vs. passive).
- Adapt existing calibration pipeline to handle extended wavelength range.
- Prototype LED and laser diode arrays for 1000–1700 nm illumination.
- Evaluate material transmission of common lenses and windows in the SWIR band.
