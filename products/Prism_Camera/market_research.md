# Market Research

## Customers
- Broadcast, cinema, and industrial imaging where color fidelity and high sensitivity are paramount.
- Machine-vision integrators requiring maximum throughput without CFA losses.

## Competitors
- JAI and Hitachi 3CCD cameras dominate this niche.
- Multi-sensor rigs used in cinema provide similar benefits at larger scale.

Prices remain high (>$5k per camera head), limiting adoption to specialized industries such as broadcast and machine vision. The market is stable but small, with incremental demand from high-end production houses.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Sales volumes of existing 3CCD cameras are estimated to confirm at least a $3M annual market.
- Component suppliers for prism blocks and sensors are identified with pricing.
- Performance benchmarks show measurable improvement over Bayer cameras in sensitivity and color accuracy.
