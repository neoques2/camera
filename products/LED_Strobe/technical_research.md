# Technical Research

- Evaluate available LED wavelengths and output power.
- Characterize camera sensitivity and global-shutter performance.
- Determine optimum strobe duration and synchronization scheme.
- Compare discrete LED arrays to commercial spectral engines for uniformity and speed.
- Design a diffuser box or integrating sphere for uniform illumination.
- Measure FWHM of each LED with a spectrometer; test optional 10 nm bandpass filters.
- Select strobe controllers supporting microsecond timing (e.g., Gardasoft PP series).
- Develop software to reconstruct spectral cubes using calibrated LED spectra.
- Investigate thermal drift of LED peak wavelength across operating temperature.
- Prototype microcontroller firmware to drive LEDs and trigger the camera at >100 fps.
