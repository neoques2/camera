  - [ ] Keep this checklist updated.
- [ ] Characterize LED wavelength shift vs. temperature and compensate in firmware.
- [ ] Program microcontroller to support >100â€¯fps strobe sequencing.
- [ ] What LED wavelengths offer the best balance of cost, availability, and spectral coverage?
- [ ] Should the strobe controller be custom built or purchased off the shelf?
  - [ ] Compare discrete LED array to commercial spectral engine options.
  - [ ] Test diffuser box for spatial uniformity and record illumination profiles.
  - [ ] Estimate total BOM cost for camera, LEDs, driver, and optics.
  - [ ] Document calibration workflow for LED spectra and camera response.
- [ ] Is an integrating sphere needed for consistent output, or will a simple diffuser suffice?
