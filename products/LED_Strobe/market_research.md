# Market Research

The LED-strobe camera targets budget QA applications, educational kits, and research labs wanting simple spectral imaging. Growth is driven by makers and universities adopting open-source reconstruction tools. Competing options include Labsphere and Gamma Scientific LED engines aimed at calibration labs and various DIY arrays built from Thorlabs LEDs.

- Filter-wheel cameras and entry-level hyperspectral modules provide alternative low-cost systems.
- Typical kit pricing ranges from $1k to $4k with steady single-digit CAGR as LED costs fall.
- Key buyers include food processing plants, small research labs, and teaching laboratories seeking affordable experimentation platforms.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Three documented case studies validate demand for low-cost multispectral imaging.
- BOM and pricing analysis shows >40% margin on 100-unit production runs.
- Distribution partnerships or online storefronts for DIY kits are confirmed.
