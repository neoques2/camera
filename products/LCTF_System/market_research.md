# Market Research

LCTF cameras appeal to biomedical labs and museum imaging projects that value electronic tuning and no moving parts. Modules cost $5kâ€“$7k depending on bandwidth and range. Vendors include Thorlabs, Channel Systems, and Azur Light. LCTFs compete against filter-wheel cameras that offer faster throughput but add mechanical complexity.

- Demand remains moderate in cultural heritage imaging, where stability and repeatable spectral bands outweigh speed.
- Bundled systems with scientific cameras typically undercut AOTF solutions on price while delivering adequate switching times for still scenes.
- Growth drivers include non-contact fluorescence research and portable museum documentation.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Pricing data is gathered from at least three LCTF vendors.
- Market demand is evidenced by two or more museums or labs seeking non-mechanical spectral capture.
- ROI analysis shows payback within 24 months at projected unit pricing.
