# Technical Research

## Components
- Foveon X3 sensor module or camera body (e.g., Sigma fp L).
- Lens with high sharpness to exploit full-color pixels.
- Image processing pipeline tuned for layered photodiode data.

## Performance Goals
- Demonstrate improved color resolution vs. Bayer sensors.
- Quantify noise and dynamic range penalties.
- Evaluate demosaicing-free workflow for spectral reconstruction tasks.
