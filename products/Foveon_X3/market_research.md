# Market Research

## Customers
- Enthusiast photographers interested in unique color rendition and fine detail.
- Scientific imaging users who benefit from pixel-level spectral capture without demosaicing.

## Competitors
- Sigma's Foveon DSLRs and mirrorless cameras dominate this niche market.
- High-megapixel Bayer sensors offer cheaper alternatives with lower noise.

The overall market remains small because sensor availability is limited and Foveon designs exhibit higher noise compared to Bayer sensors. Adoption is mostly among photo enthusiasts and niche scientific applications.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Sales data from Sigma or third parties indicates at least 10k units sold annually worldwide.
- Component sourcing for stacked photodiode sensors is identified with estimated pricing.
- Comparative performance testing shows clear advantages over Bayer sensors for targeted use cases.
