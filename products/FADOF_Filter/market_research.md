# Market Research

## Customers
- Scientific instruments targeting atomic transitions or solar observations.
- Specialty remote-sensing systems requiring sub-nanometer passbands.

## Competitors
- Custom atomic vapor cell providers and optics labs.
- AOTF and etalon-based narrowband filters address similar niche applications.

Demand is limited to research labs and aerospace projects due to complexity and narrow use. Pricing depends heavily on the custom vapor cell and can exceed $10k per filter system.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- At least two use cases demonstrate a need for GHz-wide passbands that existing filters cannot meet.
- Quotes are obtained from vapor-cell suppliers to establish realistic cost ranges.
- Technical feasibility analysis shows stable performance over temperature and magnetic field variations.
