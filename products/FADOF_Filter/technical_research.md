# Technical Research

## Components
- Atomic vapor cell tuned to desired line (e.g., rubidium or sodium).
- Heater and magnetic field control for resonance tuning.
- Narrowband laser source or solar telescopic optics.

## Performance Goals
- Achieve <5 GHz passband with >70% transmission at resonance.
- Stabilize filter response over temperature and magnetic field variations.
- Evaluate imaging feasibility vs. monochromatic application needs.
