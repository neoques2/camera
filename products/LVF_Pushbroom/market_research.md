# Market Research

The LVF push-broom concept addresses art conservation, geological core scanning, and static-scene analytics requiring continuous spectra. Museums and geology labs drive adoption as they digitize collections for remote analysis. Commercial LVFs cost $1kâ€“$3k depending on range and size, while complete push-broom cameras from Specim and Headwall remain pricey.

- Customers appreciate continuous spectral sampling for pigment studies and mineral identification.
- Budget-focused users retrofit machine-vision cameras with LVFs to avoid expensive turnkey lines.
- Market growth is modest but steady as cultural heritage projects expand worldwide.

## Viability Metric
Research is complete when:
- Market size estimates show at least $5M annual spend on LVF-based systems.
- Competitive analysis lists three or more existing commercial offerings with pricing.
- At least two potential pilot users (museum or geology lab) express interest.
