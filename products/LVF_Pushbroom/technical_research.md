# Technical Research

- Determine optimal stage precision and scanning speed.
- Assess LVF spectral uniformity and blocking performance.
- Develop calibration process linking stage position to wavelength.
- Select a linear stage with sub-micron repeatability; compare stepper and servo options.
- Investigate vibration isolation and scanning jitter impact on image quality.
- Integrate stage control (USB or Ethernet) with camera triggering for synchronized motion.
- Evaluate field-of-view vs. LVF wavelength mapping and correct for distortions.
- Characterize thermal drift of the LVF using a temperature-controlled stage.
- Explore continuous scanning vs. step-and-shoot to maximize acquisition speed.
