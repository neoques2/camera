# Repo Navigation Instructions

- The root contains overall notes (`Conversation.md`, `Notes.md`), a task overview (`Tasks.md`), and a template folder.
- Add new product ideas inside `products/` using the files in `template/` as a guide.
- Each product folder must include:
  - `README.md`
  - `market_research.md`
  - `technical_research.md`
  - `tasks.md`
- Keep tasks independent for each product and update their respective `tasks.md` files.
- Run `git status --short` before committing to ensure a clean working tree.
