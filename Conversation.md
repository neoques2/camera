Camera's typically have pixels that are all effectively the same (unless they're infrared/ultraviolet), What makes the pixels have different colors are the different filters on them. Later the're debayed. How are these filters made?

Color in most CMOS image sensors comes from a color filter array (CFA) patterned over otherwise color‑agnostic pixels, plus microlenses that funnel light into each photodiode. These layers are built with semiconductor-style photolithography on top of the pixel stack (on the back side for modern BSI sensors).

How the Bayer/CFA layers are made

Prepare the pixel surface. After wiring and passivation, the wafer surface is planarized. For BSI sensors, the wafer is thinned and processing continues from the light‑entry side. Optical isolation features (e.g., deep trench isolation, DTI) may be formed to limit crosstalk.

Spin‑coat a colored photoresist. A liquid color resist—a polymer matrix carrying organic dyes or inorganic pigments (e.g., DNQ‑novolac, acrylates, polyimide, SU‑8, PVA formulations)—is dispensed and spin‑coated to a controlled thickness, then soft‑baked.

Photolithography & develop. Using a photomask aligned to the pixel grid, the layer is exposed and developed so that only the desired pixels retain that color (often green first because it’s half the mosaic). A hard bake / cure fixes the film; an overcoat or planarization step may follow. The cycle is repeated for G, R, and B, with tight overlay tolerances. Dyes can interfere with UV exposure, so material systems and exposure wavelengths are tuned to maintain resolution. 
Wikipedia
Image Sensors World

Microlens formation. A transparent resist is patterned into disks and then thermally reflowed to form hemispherical microlenses above each pixel; alternatives use etched dielectric microlenses or a two‑lens “light pipe” (dielectric lens under an organic top lens) to better guide light in deep pixel stacks.

Materials & variations you’ll see

Pigment vs. dye resists. Pigment‑based CFAs generally offer better thermal/photochemical stability and narrow spectral bands; dye systems can be simpler but need care with UV exposure chemistry.

Dielectric/interference CFAs. Some sensors replace organic color resists with multilayer dielectric or metal–dielectric stacks (Fabry–Pérot cavities) patterned per pixel. Benefits include thin films, high temperature robustness, and good UV stability, at the cost of extra deposition and tuning steps.

This sounds much more sophisticated than I expected. I presumed the filters were made in advance and were overlayed onto the sensor,

Your intuition isn’t crazy—early CCD cameras sometimes did use a pre‑made color filter on a glass plate that was precisely aligned and bonded over the sensor. Theuwissen notes that Ishikawa (1981) described a glass‑plate CFA glued to a CCD, but that modern single‑chip cameras fabricate the CFA on‑chip during wafer processing (Dillon, 1978). 
Wikipedia

Why on‑wafer today?

Alignment tolerances at modern pixel pitches are brutal. A classic study showed microlens‑to‑photoactive overlay had to be ≤ 0.3 µm for a 7 µm pixel; with today’s mobile pixels at ≈1.2 µm and even <0.6 µm, allowable overlay shrinks well below a tenth of a micron. That’s only practical with wafer lithography, not post‑made sheets. 
Image Sensors World
OMNIVISION

Stack complexity. Modern sensors (especially BSI) add deep trench isolation (DTI), optical grids, and tailored microlenses to fight crosstalk. These elements must be co‑designed and lithographically registered with the CFA, again pushing the process on‑wafer. 
ResearchGate
Image Sensors World

Yield & cost. Wafer‑level processing lets you pattern millions of filters per wafer in a few lithography steps, cure them, and then add microlenses—far cheaper and higher‑yield than aligning and bonding discrete sheets to each die. (This is standard industry practice summarized in reviews and application notes.)

How they’re actually made (very short):

Spin‑coat a colored photoresist (dye or pigment in a polymer), expose through a mask, develop, cure; repeat for G, R, B. Then pattern a transparent resist for microlenses and thermo‑reflow to hemispheres (or use dielectric lenses).

IR‑cut filters: the broad IR‑blocking element is typically a separate thin‑film glass filter at module level (sometimes switchable for day/night), not the per‑pixel CFA. Research shows pixel‑scale dielectric CFAs can include IR suppression, but that’s different from the usual module IR‑cut.

Right—the on‑sensor CFAs and microlenses are wafer‑fabricated and need cleanroom lithography. That’s out of “apartment lab” range. But a multispectral camera you can build is very feasible if you move the filtering in front of a monochrome sensor and then calibrate the spectra.

Practical build paths (from easiest to harder)
Liquid‑crystal tunable filter (LCTF) + mono camera

Pros: No moving parts, electronic tuning; decent image quality.

Cons: Polarization sensitive; modest transmission; 10–35 nm FWHM typical; 100–250 ms switching.

Example specs: Thorlabs Kurios VIS 420–730 nm, 10 nm FWHM option, ~17% polarized transmission, <250 ms switch. 
Thorlabs

Acousto‑optic tunable filter (AOTF) + mono camera

Pros: Fast (<100 µs tuning), narrow bands (≈1–10 nm), programmable; can select multiple wavelengths simultaneously.

Cons: Requires RF driver; polarization & angular constraints; cost.

Example: Gooch & Housego TeO₂ AOTF, 450–670 nm, ~4 nm bandwidth, 2.5 mm aperture; larger‑aperture units support full‑frame spectral imaging.

Linear variable filter (LVF)

A thin‑film interference filter whose passband varies along one dimension. Mount it close to the sensor and either:

Pushbroom: move the scene or filter to scan; or

Snapshot‑mosaic: use a 2‑D tiling of narrowband wedges (requires custom fabrication).

LVFs are commercially available; custom multi‑band/LVF designs are a service industry (e.g., Delta Optical Thin Film).

MEMS tunable Fabry–Pérot (FP)

Compact, high throughput, good for IR; available as components but less “plug‑and‑play” than LCTF.

Snapshot mosaic sensors (filters on chip)

If you want no scanning, buy a ready sensor with a mosaic of spectral bands (e.g., 4×4 or 5×5 patterns). imec offers VIS and NIR versions; Pixelteq/PixelCam is another route. You then demosaic and reconstruct a cube.

2) Linear Variable Bandpass Filter (LVF) push‑broom (VNIR)
~550–1000 nm (VIS‑NIR sample item) → 7–20 nm → depends on scan; e.g., 225 steps at 2 nm spacing ≈ 2–4 s for a frame stack → ~$3k–$6k.

Hardware.

Mono camera + linear stage (or scene motion).

Performance. High throughput; simple optics. True continuous sweep possible by small spatial steps.

Trade‑offs. Requires scanning (scene must be static or line‑scan geometry).

3) LCTF imaging (VNIR or NIR)
VIS 420–730 nm or NIR 650–1100 nm → selectable 10/18/32 nm → 70–750 ms per wavelength → ~$9k–$10k.

Trade‑offs. Simple, no scanning; lower transmission and slower than AOTF.

4) AOTF imaging + broadband source (fast, narrow bands)
Coverage depends on crystal (e.g., 450–670 nm VIS; 700–1200 nm NIR; units exist from 351–4500 nm) → 0.3–12 nm bands → ≤10–50 µs tuning; video‑rate cubes → ≈ $10k–$40k (+ source).

Recommendations
Lowest cost to start (VNIR): build LED strobe + IMX250. Buy ~12 LEDs (420–940 nm), add a few 10 nm bandpass filters for critical bands. Calibrate each channel’s spectrum (borrow a spectrometer once). 
Edmund Optics
Labsphere

Continuous spectrum with better resolution, still affordable: LVF push‑broom. If you can tolerate scanning, you’ll get 7–20 nm bands inexpensively.

Narrower bands or high‑FPS cubes: AOTF. Start with a VIS AOTF (~$5k class) and a bright lamp/LED engine; upgrade to supercontinuum later for full flexibility.

Thought for 2m 39s
Great—let’s turn the four builds we discussed into concrete, buyable parts lists, with model numbers, approximate prices, and key specs. I’ve focused on readily available components and cited sources for specs and pricing.

1) Ultra‑budget VIS–NIR system: strobed LEDs + mono global‑shutter camera
Goal: 400–1000 nm coverage using a bank of discrete LEDs strobed sequentially; spectral resolution set by LED FWHM (typically ~20–50 nm; can be narrowed on a few channels with 10 nm bandpass filters). Fast, inexpensive, robust.

Core parts

Camera (global shutter, 5 MP IMX250):
Teledyne FLIR Blackfly S BFS‑U3‑51S5M‑C, USB3.
2448×2048, up to 75 FPS; exposure range 20 µs–30 s; 10/12‑bit. Approx $960–$1,200. Use FLIR Spinnaker SDK. 
FLIR Software Services
Edmund Optics

Alternative higher‑FPS camera (IMX174):
Basler acA1920‑155um (USB3). 1920×1200 @ 155–164 FPS, 5.86 µm pixels, wide dynamic range. ~$1,200–$1,500. 
Basler
Edmund Optics
BCF Technion

Lens (C‑mount, 2/3″ format):
Any good FA lens; e.g., Kowa LM25JC (25 mm, f/1.4) or Fujinon HF25SA‑1. Used market often $60–$200; new FA lenses typically $150–$400. (Examples shown to illustrate price range.) 
eBay

LED set (example wavelengths): choose ~12–16 channels to span 400–1000 nm. Thorlabs mounted LEDs provide published center λ and power; unmounted LEDs extend to 265–1650 nm. Typical FWHM VIS ≈20–35 nm, NIR ≈30–50 nm. Example picks: 405, 430, 455, 470, 505, 525, 590, 625, 660, 730, 810, 850, 880, 940, 1050 nm (the last via unmounted/InGaAs LED if needed). Prices commonly $250–$350 each for mounted VIS/NIR (e.g., M850L3 $274.55). 
Thorlabs

LED strobe controller (µs timing / over‑drive):
Gardasoft PP series (e.g., PP480, successor to PP420F). Designed for machine‑vision LED pulsing, microsecond-scale control, over‑current driving; “pricing similar to PP420F”—typically a few thousand USD (ask for quote). 
Gardasoft

Diffuser / light box:
Low‑cost, high‑throughput diffuser. Example: Thorlabs ED1‑C20 engineered diffuser, 25.4 mm, ~90% transmission 380–1100 nm, $152.54. Use a shallow integrating cavity for uniformity. 
Thorlabs

Optional narrow bands for a few points:
Edmund Optics hard‑coated 10 nm FWHM bandpass filters, Ø25 mm, OD>4, to tighten a couple of critical wavelengths. (Edmund’s bandpass family notes 2–5 nm “laser line” and 10 nm “narrowband” options.) 
Edmund Optics
Edmund Optics

Calibration spectrometer (recommended):
Thorlabs CCT10 (successor to CCS200) 200–1000 nm, <2 nm resolution; legacy CCS200 price reference $3,340.44 (discontinued Feb 17 2025). Ocean Insight FLAME VIS‑NIR 350–1000 nm; indicative price ~$6,300 depending on config. 
Thorlabs
Thorlabs
Thorlabs
Global FIA

Why this works

Typical LED spectral widths and spacing: VIS channel spacing ~15–20 nm (as used by calibration sources) and NIR channels wider; your achievable resolution per frame is ~LED FWHM. Add a few 10 nm filters where you want finer points. References show VIS LEDs with ~15–35 nm spacing used in calibration light engines. 
Gamma Scientific
Imatest
Edmund Optics

Silicon sensors inherently cut off near 1100 nm (Si bandgap 1.12 eV → 1100 nm cutoff), so expect rapidly dropping response beyond ~1000 nm. 
Hamamatsu Photonics
Thorlabs
PMC

Approx budget (12–16 LEDs):
Camera $1.0–1.2k + lens $150–400 + LEDs $3.3–5.0k + controller $2–3k + diffusers/mounts ~$300 → ≈$6.7–9.9k (fewer LEDs drops cost; used LEDs/lens can push near $3–5k). Calibration spectrometer adds ~$3–6k.

2) Low‑cost “push‑broom” with Linear‑Variable Bandpass Filter (LVF)
Goal: Use a linear variable bandpass filter in front of the lens or illumination path. Translate the LVF relative to the beam to scan center wavelength. Achieves ~7–20 nm FWHM, OD ≥ 4 blocking. Works with the same mono camera.

MeetOptics
MeetOptics

Motorized linear stage (scan axis):
Zaber T‑LSM150A integrated‑controller stage, 150 mm travel, 0.1 µm encoder option, USB/serial control. Indicative $2,700. (Shorter travel stages are cheaper; travel needed ≈ the LVF’s clear length plus margin.) 
Edmund Optics

Mounting: kinematic filter carrier to hold the 60×12 mm LVF at the correct angle; cage rails to maintain alignment.

Illumination: broad, uniform white source (LED array or integrating‑sphere source); diffuser as in Build #1. 
Thorlabs

Notes

LVFs give you continuous tunability over the listed range with 7–20 nm FWHM (varies with position). You trade scan time for spectral density. 
Edmund Optics
MeetOptics

For objects larger than the clear 0.5×10 mm “optimum beam” on the LVF, either scan the LVF in front of a collimated beam (illumination‑side) or image a thin line region of interest. 
Edmund Optics

Approx budget: Camera+lens $1.2–1.6k + two LVFs ~$3.8k + stage ~$2.7k + mounts/diffusers ~$400 → ≈$8.1k. (One LVF for VIS only brings it to ≈$6.2k.)

3) Snapshot imaging with an LCTF (liquid‑crystal tunable filter)
Goal: Narrow, electronically tunable bandpass placed in front of the lens. No moving stage. Ideal when you want cleaner bands and simple control; slower than LED strobing (tens to hundreds of ms per hop), but simple and precise.

Core parts

LCTF (VIS):
Thorlabs KURIOS series.

KURIOS‑VB1 (420–730 nm) selectable bandwidth (Narrow/Medium/Wide); max switching ~230 ms (Narrow), 150 ms (Medium), 100 ms (Wide). 
Channel Systems
Azimp Micro

KURIOS‑WB1 (420–730 nm, wide fixed bandwidth). Thorlabs list shows controller KURIOS2 $11,523, and example filter K2XE2 (650–1100 nm) price $12,487; VIS filters are typically in the same ballpark (request quote).

KURIOS‑XE2 (650–1100 nm, FWHM ~17 nm at 850 nm, switching <250 ms). 
EMIN.COM.MM

Controller: Thorlabs KURIOS2 (required). $11,523 list. 
Edmund Optics

Camera & lens: same as Build #1. 
FLIR Software Services

Notes

For full 400–1000 nm you’d typically use two LCTFs (VIS + NIR). Expect ~10–35 nm FWHM depending on model/bandwidth and wavelength; switching times map depends on hop size (Thorlabs provides per‑unit switching maps). 
Thorlabs
Channel Systems

Approx budget: Controller $11.5k + one filter $12–13k (VIS or NIR) + camera/lens ~$1.3k → ≈$25–26k for a single band, ≈$37–39k for VIS+NIR pair. 
Edmund Optics

4) Fast, fine‑resolution tunable system: AOTF + broadband source
Goal: Microsecond wavelength switching, few‑nanometer bandwidth (e.g., 4–5 nm), high out‑of‑band suppression, and random access wavelength jumps. Best when you need speed and programmable spectral mixing. Cost and alignment complexity are higher.

Core parts

AOTF crystals (examples, TeO₂):

Gooch & Housego AOTF 2885‑04: 450–670 nm, 4 nm bandwidth, 2.5 mm aperture.

Broadband source:

Supercontinuum laser (e.g., NKT Photonics SuperK). Delivers high brightness from VIS into NIR/SWIR; typical systems are tens of thousands of USD (used listings show ~$30–50k). 
eBay
CAE Online

Lower‑cost alternative: high‑power white LED or xenon lamp into a collimated beam—works but with far lower spectral radiance; AOTF diffraction efficiency and SNR may suffer. (Use integrating sphere + irradiance monitor; Labsphere offers calibrated spheres/detectors covering 350–1100 nm (Si) and 800–1700 nm (InGaAs).) 
Labsphere

Camera & lens: same as Build #1 (or SWIR camera if you push >1.0 µm heavily). 
FLIR Software Services

Approx budget: Two AOTFs (VIS + NIR) typically $20–40k combined (quote), RF driver(s) $3–10k, supercontinuum $30–60k (new) → ≈$55–110k+. A xenon/LED alternative reduces source cost drastically but limits performance.

5) SWIR extension (400–1700 nm) with a Vis‑SWIR sensor
Goal: Add short‑wave IR. Replace the Si camera with a Sony SenSWIR IMX990 (400–1700 nm) camera; reuse LED strobing or use a tunable source. Bandpass filters or SWIR LVFs/LCTFs can refine bandwidth.

Core parts

NKT Photonics

SWIR illumination options:

Discrete SWIR LEDs (1050, 1200, 1300, 1450, 1550, 1650 nm). Thorlabs offers unmounted LEDs up to 4.4 µm; mounted range to 1650 nm. 
Thorlabs

Basler
NKT Photonics
Thorlabs
Gardasoft

Practical assembly notes & choices
Timing / exposure: FLIR lists 20 µs minimum exposure on BFS‑U3‑51S5; community posts show min exposure can increase when triggers are enabled. Plan gating with the LED controller accordingly. (Some camera families quote ~10–20 µs; verify on your unit.) 
FLIR Software Services
Teledyne Vision Solutions
MeetOptics

Spectral response limits: Si sensors roll off toward 1100 nm due to the 1.12 eV bandgap of silicon. Expect lower QE and higher noise near 1000–1100 nm; for strong >1.0 µm work, prefer IMX990/InGaAs. 
Hamamatsu Photonics
Thorlabs
Sony Semiconductor

LED spectra & spacing: Calibration light engines (Gamma Scientific RS‑7/RS‑9) use ~32–35 VIS channels with ~15 nm spacing and wider spacing in NIR (channel FWHM VIS ~20 nm, NIR ~50 nm), a useful template for choosing discrete LEDs. 
Gamma Scientific

Imatest

Uniformity: A small integrating sphere or engineered diffuser improves spatial uniformity; Labsphere’s documentation and products cover LED radiometry and integrating spheres, with calibrated Si and InGaAs detectors.

Isomet
G&H

Which bill of materials should you build first?
Fastest & cheapest to get working: Build #1 (strobed LEDs). You can start with 8–10 LEDs (~$3–5k all‑in with a used lens) and add channels later. This also gives you a good illumination platform for the other builds. 
Thorlabs
FLIR Software Services

Best “continuous spectrum” control under ~$10k: Build #2 (LVF + stage). You’ll get 7–20 nm bands anywhere in 400–1000 nm with clean blocking, at the cost of a scan. 
Edmund Optics
Edmund Optics

Cleanest turnkey tunability (no mechanics): Build #3 (LCTF), but it costs more.

Opportunities for you
Calibration, analytics, and decision‑support software. Reviews flag standardization gaps; devices produce StO₂/Hb maps but clinicians want action thresholds (e.g., flap salvage alerts, HBOT candidacy, PAD triage). Build validated analytics and dashboards; anchor with CPT 0061U / 0640T workflows.

Next steps I can do
Drill into TAM/SAM for each niche (U.S.) using procedure volumes (e.g., number of HBOT cases, reconstructive flaps, burn admissions, wound‑care clinic counts) and payer mix to quantify spend capture with 0061U/064xT vs bundled ICG.

Compile a detailed FDA dossier table (all 510(k) numbers, product codes, years, indications, and predicates).

Assemble payer policy excerpts (MACs, major commercial plans) mentioning 0061U / 0640T–0642T / 93922–93923 and FA/ICG coverage.

If you tell me which two niches you want to pursue first (e.g., wound centers vs. reconstructive surgery), I’ll produce those deeper cuts with addressable market, likely buyers in Texas, and an initial sales script tied to reimbursement.


Given the above conversations split up the range of tasks into a useful hierarchy. The end goal is a useful product. I suspect there are many trees/branches of work to be considered.
