# Notes from Conversation

## Hardware Ideas
1. **Build #1: LED-Strobed Multispectral Camera** - use discrete LEDs or LED engines to sequentially illuminate and capture with a mono camera. Requires strobe controller, diffuser, calibration of each LED.
2. **Build #2: Linear Variable Filter (LVF) Push-broom** - continuous spectrum captured via scanning LVF in front of the camera. Needs linear stage, careful alignment.
3. **Build #3: Liquid Crystal Tunable Filter (LCTF)** - electronically selects band, slower switching. Works without moving parts. Requires dedicated controller.
4. **Build #4: Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF)** - fast microsecond tuning with narrow bands. Needs RF driver and bright broadband source (e.g. supercontinuum).
5. **Build #5: SWIR Extension** - use a SWIR sensor (e.g., Sony IMX990) to extend coverage to 400-1700 nm. Pair with above filtering approaches.

## Potential Markets / Use Cases

## Medical Device Landscape
- Devices like HyperMed HyperView, Kent SnapshotNIR, Modulim Ox-Imager, ViOptix Intra.Ox, Moor Instruments LDI, Diaspective Vision TIVITA.
- FDA clearances and CPT reimbursement codes exist (e.g., 0061U, 0640T-0642T).
- Opportunities around calibration software, analytics, and reimbursement toolkits.
