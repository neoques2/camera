# Overall Task Hierarchy

Refer to `ROOT_TEMPLATE.md` for the project layout. Each product folder mirrors the template in `template/`.

## Research Completion Tasks
The following actions ensure all research topics in `Notes.md` are thoroughly covered:
- [ ] Summarize hardware approaches listed under **Hardware Ideas**.
- [ ] Outline potential markets from **Potential Markets / Use Cases**.
- [ ] Compile an overview of existing medical imaging devices referenced in **Medical Device Landscape**.
- [ ] Capture open questions or follow-up items for each product folder's `tasks.md`.
