# Overall Task Hierarchy

Refer to `ROOT_TEMPLATE.md` for the project layout. Each product folder mirrors the template in `template/`.

## Research Completion Tasks
The following actions ensure all research topics in `Notes.md` are thoroughly covered:
- [x] Summarize hardware approaches listed under **Hardware Ideas**.
- [x] Outline potential markets from **Potential Markets / Use Cases**.
- [x] Compile an overview of existing medical imaging devices referenced in **Medical Device Landscape**.
- [x] Capture open questions or follow-up items for each product folder's `tasks.md`.
- [x] Summarize color filter array manufacturing steps.
- [x] List tunable light source options and trade-offs.
- [x] Document calibration methods for multispectral cameras.
- [x] Briefly note prism cameras, Foveon sensors, snapshot mosaics, and FADOFs as alternative approaches.
